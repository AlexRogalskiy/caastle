=========

Platform of containerized applications/microservices includes application/web servers, container orchestration engine clusters,
and applicationâ€™s external resource dependencies such as managed database servers.
Platform-as-Code_ paradigm offers ability to define all such platform elements of a containerized cloud application using declarative configuration files.
These platform definitions can be version controlled and follow software development lifecycle.

CaaStle is a **full-stack microservices development and deployment tool** that is implemented using Platform-as-Code principles.
Currently CaaStle supports Google Cloud and Amazon AWS.

Key elements of CaaStle

- **Intelligent abstractions**:

  *Environment* is the top level abstraction. It defines container orchestration engine cluster and managed cloud services for the application.
  *Application* is composed of one or more application container/s and is deployed in the environment.
  You get a shell customized for the environment with ability to directly use cloud-native CLIs against the platform elements created in that environment.

- **Declarative platform definition**:

  *environment yaml* file is used to define managed cloud resources within an environment; *application yaml* is used to define application
  container (for single container applications);
  *pod/deployment yaml or ecs's task yaml* is supported for multi-container applications.
  No need for platform inputs using command line parameters.

- **Platform element association**:

  Integrated creation and binding of cloud resources with application containers provides view of the entire application run-time environment with
  appropriate platform elements associations.

- **Environment change history**:

  History of operations that change the state of an environment is maintained for traceability and repeatability.

- **Non-hosted implementation**:

  CaaStle is a non-hosted implementation. There is no centralized server like PaaS implementations. CaaStle can be installed anywhere alongside Docker.
  This architecture enables effective local development with Docker environments setup on the individual workstations or laptops.
  The non-hosted nature also simplifies integration of CaaStle with any DevOps workflow.


Use CaaStle to develop and deploy full-stack microservices on Google GKE and Amazon ECS:

- Common language between developers and Ops to share the platform definition of a containerized cloud application. 

- Full-stack application view for better control. 

- Ultimate dev/prod parity_ between local Docker environment and production cloud environment.

- Non-hosted implementation for simplicity and usability.

Try CaaStle
-------------

Developed and Tested on:

- Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04

- Mac OS (El Capitan 10.11.4)

Requires:

- Docker 1.6 and above

- Python 2.7

CaaStle requires Docker to be installed. If you do not have Docker, you can install it following steps from:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

On Mac OS, make sure the command shell from which you are installing CaaStle is able to run docker commands
without sudo. You can achieve this by executing following command in the shell once Docker VM is up and running:

eval "$(docker-machine env default)"


Once you have installed Docker follow these steps:


1) Clone this repository

2) Install CaaStle

   $ ./install.sh

3) Do cloud setup

   $ cld setup aws

   $ cld setup gcloud

4) Start CaaStle server

   $ ./start-cloudark.sh

5) Choose a sample application from examples folder and follow the steps in the included README

Details
--------

1) **How is Platform-as-Code different from Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)?**

Platform-as-Code is a *non-hosted* implementation of platform functionality.
There is no private / public hosted central server like PaaSes. This approach helps improve dev/prod parity and ability to recreate application environments anywhere.

2) **How is Platform-as-Code different from Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) ?**

Infrastructure-as-Code implementation treats every platform element as infrastructure resource.
In contrast, Platform-as-Code offers *application-centric abstractions* that simplify modeling a deployment as per the application architecture.
