Welcome to CloudARK's documentation
====================================

Platform of an application is defined as the run-time environment in which the application runs. It includes application code, application servers, and applicationâ€™s external resource dependencies such as databases.

In case of a containerized cloud application, platform elements generally include:

- Application container/s

- Container orchestration engine cluster

- Required managed cloud services like database-as-a-service, load balancers etc.

Platform-as-Code paradigm offers ability to define all platform elements of a containerized cloud application using declarative configuration files. These platform definitions can be version controlled and follow software development lifecycle. Refer to our free whitepaper_ for more about Platform-as-Code (PaC) paradigm.
CloudARK is an implementation of Platform-as-Code (PaC) paradigm.
