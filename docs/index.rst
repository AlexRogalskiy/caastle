Welcome to CloudARK's documentation
====================================

Platform of an application is defined as the run-time environment in which the application runs. 
Platform-as-Code paradigm offers ability to define all platform elements of a containerized cloud application using declarative configuration files. 
These platform definitions can be version controlled and follow software development lifecycle.

CloudARK is implementation of Platform-as-Code (PaC) paradigm.

There are two main abstractions in CloudARK - *Environment* and *Application*.
