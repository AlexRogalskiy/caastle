Troubleshooting
----------------

Here is list of things you can do to start troubleshooting issues/failures:

1) Relevant Files and directories:

   - install.log: This file contains CloudARK client and server installation logs

   - cld.log: This file contains the server's runtime logs

   - cloudark-virtenv: This is the virtual environment in which CloudARK client and server are installed


2) Check the files that are generated by CloudARK for deployment
   
   - CloudARK stores generated files in directories inside the ~/.cld/data/deployments directory


3) Check if all the extensions have loaded correctly
   
   $ source cloudark-virtenv/bin/activate

   $ epi group list

     You should see list of all the loaded stevedore extensions. CloudARK extensions are available
     under "server.server_plugins" namespace.

   $ epi group show server.server_plugins.aws.coe

     Shows the aws.coe extensions

   $ epi group show server.server_plugins.gcloud.app

     Shows the gcloud.app extensions


3) Use environment-specific shell to run cloud's native CLI commands


4) Install and start CloudARK in fresh virtual environment manually:
   
   $ virtualenv freshinstall

   $ source freshinstall/bin/activate

   $ pip install -r requirements.txt

   $ python client/setup.py install

   $ python server/setup.py install

   $ python server/fmserver.py

   Open another shell window, start the virtual environment, and then run client commands.
   Note that you need to be in the directory where Dockerfile is present to run client commands.
